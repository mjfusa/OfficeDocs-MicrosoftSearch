# Deploy Microsoft Graph connectors in Teams admin center

>[!Caution]
> The Microsoft Graph connector management in the Teams Admin Center is deprecated. Starting April 14, 2025, you will no longer be able to turn Microsoft Graph connections on or off for Teams apps from the Teams admin center. To manage Microsoft Graph connectors, use the Search & Intelligence feature in the Microsoft 365 admin center, or contact the app’s owner or developer.

This article describes how to deploy partner-built Microsoft Graph connectors with a single click in the Teams admin center. The connectors index content from these partners into Microsoft Graph so that content can participate in experiences such as Copilot for Microsoft 365, Microsoft Search, and more.

## Partners with Microsoft Graph connector Teams apps
Currently, the following partners have Microsoft Graph connectors that can be deployed from Teams admin center:

## Deploying a Microsoft Graph connector Teams apps
Follow these steps to deploy a Microsoft Graph connector Teams app:
1. Sign into [Teams admin center](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/) as a Global admin or Teams admin of the tenant.
2. Select the **Manage apps** blade in the left rail.
3. Search for your desired app in the search bar.
4. On the detail page of the Teams app, navigate to the **Permissions** tab and ensure you grant consent to the requested permissions.
5. On the detail page of the Teams app, navigate to the **Microsoft Graph connector**, and click **Connection status**.
6. Wait while the connection is in progress. Once you enable the Microsoft Graph connector, the Connection status is **on** in Teams admin center. At this point, you manage the Microsoft Graph connector from the [Data Sources tab](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home#/MicrosoftSearch/Connectors) in Microsoft 365 admin center's Search & Intelligence portal.
7. If you want to delete the Microsoft Graph connector, you can do so by turning off the Connection status toggle in Teams admin center or deleting the Microsoft Graph connector in the Data sources tab.
