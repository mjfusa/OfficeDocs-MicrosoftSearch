# Trello Microsoft Graph connector (Preview)

The Trello Graph connector allows your organization to index cards from Trello. After you configure the connector, end users can search for these tickets from Trello in Microsoft Copilot and from any Microsoft Search client.

This ticket is for Microsoft 365 administrators or anyone who configures, runs, and monitors a Trello Graph connector.

>[!NOTE]
>The Trello connector is in public preview. If you wish to get access to try it, you need to enable [Targeted Release](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/release-options-in-office-365#set-up-the-release-option-in-the-admin-center) ring for your Admin account.

## Capabilities
- Index public cards from your Trello Workspace
- Customize your crawl frequency.  
- Create workflows using this connection and plugins from Microsoft Copilot Studio.  
- Use [Semantic search in Copilot](semantic-index-for-copilot.md) to enable users to find relevant content.

## Limitations
- Doesn't index comments. 
- Doesn't crawl user identities and access permissions. All public cards indexed using the Trello connector are visible to all Microsoft 365 users in your tenant, from Microsoft Search or Copilot.

## Prerequisites
### 1.	Trello Developer Account and App Registration 
Create or use an existing Trello account to access the developer portal. Register your application on https://trello.com/power-ups/admin to obtain your API credentials. [Learn more](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/trello/guides/rest-api/authorization/)  

### 2.	Get your API Key and Secret
Once your app is registered, visit API key Tab to get the unique App key and secret. These credentials are required to sign OAuth requests as part of the OAuth 1.0a flow.


## Get Started

### 1. Display name 
A display name is used to identify each citation in Copilot, helping users easily recognize the associated file or item. Display name also signifies trusted content. Display name is also used as a [content source filter](/MicrosoftSearch/custom-filters#Content-source-filters). A default value is present for this field, but you can customize it to a name that users in your organization recognize.


### 2. Authentication Type

**Trello OAuth**
Enter the Consumer key and Private secret you obtained from your Trello app console. [Learn more](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/trello/guides/rest-api/authorization/)  

### 3. Roll out to limited audience
Deploy this connection to a limited user base if you want to validate it in Copilot and other Search surfaces before expanding the rollout to a broader audience. To know more about limited rollout, [click here](staged-rollout-for-graph-connectors.md).

At this point, you're ready to create the connection for Trello. You can click on the "Create" button to publish your connection and index tickets from your Trello account.

For other settings, like **Access permissions**, **Schema**, and **Crawl frequency**, we have default values based on what works best with Trello data.


| Users | Description |
|----|---|
| Access permissions | _Default access permission is set to be visible to everyone._ |

| Content | Description |
|---|---|
| Manage Properties | _To check default properties and their schema. |

| Sync | Description |
|---|---|
| Incremental Crawl | _Frequency: Every 15 mins_ |
| Full Crawl | _Frequency: Every Day_ |

If you want to edit any of these values, you need to choose the "Custom Setup" option.

## Custom setup

Custom setup is for those admins who want to edit the default values for settings listed in the above table. Once you click on the **Custom Setup** option, you see three more tabs - **Users**, **Content**, and **Sync**.

### Users

**Access permissions**
The Trello Graph connector allows your organization to index cards from Trello. After you configure the connector, end users can search for these tickets from Trello in Microsoft Copilot and from any Microsoft Search client.

### Content

**Manage properties**

Here, you can add or remove available properties from your Trello, assign a schema to the property (define whether a property is searchable, queryable, retrievable, or refinable), change the semantic label and add an alias to the property. Properties that are selected by default are listed below.

|Source property|Label|Description|Schema|
|---|---|---|---|
|	BoardName	|		|		|		|
|	BoardUrl	|		|		|		|
|	Closed	|		|		|		|
|	DateLastActivity	|	Last modified date time	|	Date and time the item was last modified in the data source.	|	Query, Retrieve	|
|	Description	|		|		|	Search	|
|	Due	|		|		|	Query, Retrieve	|
|	DueComplete	|		|		|		|
|	Id	|		|		|	Query, Retrieve	|
|	LabelName	|		|		|	Query, Retrieve, Search	|
|	Name	|	Title	|	The title of the item that you want shown in Copilot and other search experiences	|	Query, Retrieve, Search	|
|	Start	|	Created date time	|	Date and time that the item was created in the data source	|	Query, Retrieve	|
|	Url	|	url	|	The target URL of the item in the data source	|	Query, Retrieve, Search	|

**Preview data**

Use the preview results button to verify the sample values of the selected properties and query filter.

### Sync

The refresh interval determines how often your data is synced between the data source and the Trello Microsoft Graph connector index. There are two types of refresh intervals - full crawl and incremental crawl. For more details, see [refresh settings](configure-connector.md#guidelines-for-sync-settings).

You can change the default values of the refresh interval from here if you want to.
