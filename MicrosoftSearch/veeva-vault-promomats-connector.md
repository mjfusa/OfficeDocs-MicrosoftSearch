# Veeva Vault PromoMats Microsoft Graph connector (preview)

The Veeva Vault PromoMats Microsoft Graph connector allows organizations to index promotional marketing materials from Veeva Vault into Microsoft Graph, making them accessible across Microsoft 365 experiences, including Microsoft 365 Copilot.

The connector integrates Vault PromoMats' built-in permission model, ensuring that users only access authorized content, and supports faster content generation and review through content analysis and preparation. By enhancing efficiency throughout the content lifecycle, it helps maintain brand consistency. This functionality is beneficial for marketing, medical affairs, and regulatory teams, enabling informed decision-making and reducing the time-to-market for promotional materials.

The following are the key benefits of the Veeva Vault PromoMats Microsoft Graph connector:

- **Enhanced content management and retrieval:** The connector suggests tags to organize and access relevant documents more easily.
- **AI-assisted content reuse and localization:** Facilitates content adaptation for various markets, saving time while ensuring relevance for different audiences.
- **Comprehensive document review and summarization:** AI tools help grammar, spelling, semantics, and regulatory compliance, ensuring accuracy and up-to-date promotional materials.

Additionally, the connector boosts productivity by minimizing time spent searching for information across multiple sources. By integrating Microsoft 365 Copilot and Microsoft Search with PromoMats data, it streamlines content preparation and field use. It also improves efficiency by referencing existing compliant documents and content to help generate new messaging and prepare materials effectively.

This guide is for Microsoft 365 administrators or anyone responsible for configuring, managing, and monitoring the Veeva Vault PromoMats Microsoft Graph connector.

## Prerequisites

To configure Microsoft Entra ID OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect for the Veeva Vault Microsoft Graph connector, follow these steps.

### Register an application in Microsoft Entra ID

1. Go to **Microsoft Entra admin center** > **Applications** > **App registrations** > **New registration**. 
1. In the creation form, fill out the name as your preference.
1. In the Supported account types, choose **Accounts in this organizational directory only**.
1. In the redirect URI, select **Web**, and add the following links to the **Redirect URI** field:

   - For **Microsoft 365 Enterprise**, copy and paste:
     `https://gcs.office.com/v1.0/admin/oauth/callback`
   - For **Microsoft 365 Government**, copy and paste:
     `https://gcsgcc.office.com/v1.0/admin/oauth/callback`

1. Under **Certificates & Secrets**, generate a client secret and store it securely.

### Configure OAuth in Veeva Vault

1. Create a new profile.
   1. Go to **Admin** > **Settings** > **OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect Profiles**.
   2. Fill out the label, name, and description as your preference.
   3. Set **Status** as active.
   4. In **Authorization Server Provider**, select **Azure AD**.
   5. Click **Upload AS metadata** and select **Provide Authorization Server Metadata URL**.
   6. Copy the **OpenID Connect metadata document** from **endpoints** in the overview page of the newly created application in Microsoft Entra admin center, and paste it into the field.
   7. Select **Identity is in another claim** and enter the **UPN** of the claim.
   8. In **User ID Type**, select **Federated ID**, and uncheck **Perform Strict Audience Restriction validation**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Make sure your UPN is the same as your federated ID.

2. In the newly created profile page, click **Client Applications** > **Add**. 
Use the **Client ID** from the newly created application in the Entra admin center.

3. Create security policies.
   1. Go to **Admin** > **Settings** > **Security Policies**.
   2. Click **Create** > **Single sign-on**.
   3. Fill out the name and description as your preference.
   4. In status, choose **active**.
   5. In authentication type, choose **Single Sign-on**
   6. In Single Sign-on Profile, choose a profile created based on single sign-on. For more information, see [Veeva Vault documentation](https://platform.veevavault.help/en/gr/13977/).
   7. In eSignature Profile, select **None**.
   8. In the OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect Profile, select the newly created OAuth 2.0 profile.

   For the rest of the settings, keep the default values.

4. Link user with the security policy.
   1. Go to **Admin** > **Users & Groups**.
   2. Select a user who is the vault owner.
   3. Click **Edit**.
   4. In **Details** > **Security Policy**, change the values to the newly created policy.
   5. In **Federated ID**, change it to the UPN claim of the admin identity, which is also used in the connector setup. 

## Get started

### 1. Configure display name
Provide a meaningful display name for your connector in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center. This name helps identify the connection in your workspace.

### 2. Add the Veeva Vault URL
Enter the URL of your Veeva Vault instance. For example: `https://<your-vault-domain>.veevavault.com`.

### 3. Provide authentication details

To configure the Veeva Vault PromoMats connector, select **Azure Active Directory (OIDC)** and fill in the following information:

- **Vault session ID URL:** You can find the session ID URL on the Veeva Vault interface under the path: **Admin panel** > **Settings** > **OAuth 2.0/ OpenID Connect Profiles** > the profile that's created for the connection > **Vault Session ID URL**.
- **Client ID:** The application ID for your Entra application registered for Veeva Vault. 
- **Client secret:** The client secret associated with the Entra application. Make sure that it is securely stored and accessible only to authorized personnel. 
 
> [!Important]
> Configure both Microsoft Entra ID and Veeva Vault admin settings to enable Microsoft Entra ID authentication.

### 4. Set up identity mapping

For customers who need the security settings of their Veeva PromoMats instance to be honored, click **Custom setup** > **User**. In **Map identities**, select **Non-ME-ID** as the identity type for your content source.

Enter the required information for identity mapping. For example, if you want to map identities based on email addresses, you can follow these steps.

1. Select **Mail** as the **Microsoft Entra user property**.
2. Select **Email** as the **non-Microsoft Entra user property**.
3. Use a regular expression such as `([^@]+)` to capture a sequence of one or more characters that are not the `@` symbol.
4. Create a formula to complete the mapping, such as `{0}@<your-domain>`.

This process ensures that user identity mappings are correctly established and security permissions are properly enforced.

### 5. Roll out to limited audience
Deploy this connection to a limited group of users to validate indexing and access control functionality before a full rollout.
