# PagerDuty Schedules Microsoft Graph connector (preview)

The PagerDuty Schedules Microsoft Graph connector enables your organization to index PagerDuty schedule data to make it available to Microsoft 365 Copilot and Microsoft Search. 

This article is for Microsoft 365 administrators or anyone who configures, runs, and monitors the PagerDuty Schedules Microsoft Graph connector. 

> [!NOTE]
> The PagerDuty Schedules Microsoft Graph connector is in preview. To request early access, submit the following [request form](https://forms.office.com/r/JniPmK5bzm).

## Capabilities
- Access PagerDuty schedules in Copilot using the power of Semantic search.
- Retain ACLs defined by your organization.
- Customize your crawl frequency.
- Create workflows using this connection and plugins from Microsoft Copilot Studio.

## Limitations
- When Advanced Permissions is enabled in PagerDuty, only members of the teams linked to a specific schedule can access and search for that schedule in Microsoft Search and Microsoft 365 Copilot.

## Prerequisites
1. Create a PagerDuty account with administrator permission in the PagerDuty application.
2. Add a new app in PagerDuty with OAuth 2.0 functionality enabled. For more information, see [OAuth Functionality](https://developer.pagerduty.com/docs/oauth-functionality) and [Register an App](https://developer.pagerduty.com/docs/register-an-app).
3. Select 'Scoped OAuth' in PagerDuty new app registration setting page.
4. Use the following links for the field 'Redirect URL' in PagerDuty new app registration setting page.
   
   - For M365 Enterprise, copy and paste this [URL](https://gcs.office.com/v1.0/admin/oauth/callback)
   
   - For M365 Government, copy and paste this [URL](https://gcsgcc.office.com/v1.0/admin/oauth/callback).

7. Select the following scopes in PagerDuty new app registration setting page.

   - Audit records – Read Access

   - Schedules – Read Access

   - Teams – Read Access

   - Users – Read Access

8. After you successfully complete app registration in PagerDuty, copy Client ID and Client Secret.

## Get started

### 1. Choose display name   
Choose a display name that helps users easily recognize associated files or items in a Copilot response.

### 2. Add the Instance REST API URL
PagerDuty allows customers to choose the geographic service region of the PagerDuty data centers that host their account. 

- For the US service region, the REST API URL is (https://api.pagerduty.com).
- For the EU service region, the REST API URL is (https://api.eu.pagerduty.com).

For more information, see [Service regions](https://support.pagerduty.com/main/docs/service-regions).

### 3. Choose authentication type
Enter the Client ID and Client Secret you obtained from your PagerDuty app registration setting.

### 4. Roll out to a limited audience
Deploy this connection to a limited user base to validate it in Copilot and other search surfaces before you roll it out to a broader audience.

## Custom setup 
In custom setup, you can edit any of the default values for users, content, and sync.

### Users 

#### Access permissions

Determine which users in your organization can access each item in Copilot or Search surfaces. Choose whether indexed data is visible to everyone in the organization or only to users who have access to the data source.

### Content 

#### Content filter

Two extra parameters can be used to specify the date range for crawling final schedule content in PagerDuty.

- Days Before
- Days After

The crawl start date is (Today – Days Before) and the crawl end date is (Today + Days After).

#### Manage properties
To view available properties from your iManage Cloud, assign a schema to the property (define whether a property is searchable, queryable, retrievable, or refinable), change the semantic label, and add an alias in the property. Some properties are selected by default.

|Source property|Label|Description|
|:---- |:---- |:---- |
|Id |Not applicable  | Unique ID of the schedule. |
|HtmlUrl |`url`  | URL of the schedule in PagerDuty. |
|IconUrl |`IconUrl` |  |
|Coverage | Not applicable | The percentage of the time range covered by this schedule. |
|CreatedBy |`createdBy`  | The name of the user who created the schedule. |
|CreatedDateTime | `createdDateTime` | The time at which the schedule was created. |
|Description	| Not applicable | The description of the schedule. |
|FinalSchedule	| Not applicable | This property is a list of entries in the final schedule, including user, the start time of the entry, the end time of the entry. |
|LastModifiedBy	| `lastModifiedBy` | The name of the user who last modified the schedule. |
|LastModifiedDateTime	| `lastModifiedDateTime` | The time at which the schedule was last modified. |
|Name	| `title` | The name of the schedule. |
|Summary	| Not applicable | A short-form, server-generated string by PagerDuty that provides succinct, important information about an object suitable for primary labeling of an entity in a client. In many cases, this property is identical to `name`, though it isn't intended to be an identifier. |
|Timezone	| Not applicable | The time zone of the schedule. |
|Usage	| Not applicable | The escalation policies associated with the schedule. |


### Sync 
Only full crawl is supported by PagerDuty Schedules Microsoft Graph connector. The default schedule of the full crawl is set for every day. If needed, you can adjust these schedules to fit your data refresh needs. 

## Troubleshooting

The following are common errors that can occur and how to resolve them.

1. Your security credentials have expired for this session. Please go back and sign in again with your Client ID and Client secret.
Credential info expires. Create a new app id in PagerDuty app registration setting and copy the latest Client ID and Client secret from the setting tab to authenticate.

1. Invalid credentials detected. Please check the credential info and check the permission scopes of the PagerDuty App.
Common credential error. Go back to the PagerDuty app registration setting and check if the Client ID and Client secret have the correct permission scope.

## Next steps
After you publish your connection, you can review the status under **Data sources** in the [admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com). For more information, see [Manage your connector](manage-connector.md).
