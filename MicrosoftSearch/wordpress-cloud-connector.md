# WordPress.com Microsoft Graph connector (Preview)

With the Microsoft Graph connector for WordPress.com-built websites, your organization can index published posts and pages of your WordPress.com-built websites. After you configure the connector and index content from WordPress.com-built websites, end users can search for those published posts and pages in Microsoft Copilot and from any Microsoft Search client. 

This article is for Microsoft 365 administrators or anyone who configures, runs, and monitors a WordPress.com Graph connector. 


## Capabilities
- Index published posts and pages of your WordPress.com-built website.    
- Set ingestion filters of published posts by categories. 
- Customize your crawl frequency.  
- Create workflows using this connection and plugins from Microsoft Copilot Studio.  
- Use [Semantic search in Copilot](semantic-index-for-copilot.md) to enable users to find relevant content.

## Limitations
- Doesn't index comments. 
- Doesn't crawl user identities and access permissions. All published pages or posts indexed using the WordPress connector are visible to all Microsoft 365 users in your tenant, from Microsoft Search or Copilot.

## Prerequisites
- You must be the **search admin** for your organization's Microsoft 365 tenant.
- **WordPress.com-built website URL**: To connect to your WordPress.com-built website data, you need your organization's WordPress.com-built website URL. 
- **Configure OAuth2 Authentication in WordPress.com**: To connect to WordPress.com and allow the WordPress.com Graph Connector to update webpages regularly, you need to configure and enable OAuth 2.0 Authentication in WordPress.com with the credentials to access your WordPress.com-built websites. OAuth2 is a protocol that allows applications to interact with blogs on WordPress.com-built sites running Jetpack. Find more details here.. 

## Get Started

### 1. Display name 
A display name is used to identify each citation in Copilot, helping users easily recognize the associated file or item. Display name also signifies trusted content. Display name is also used as a [content source filter](/MicrosoftSearch/custom-filters#content-source-filters). A default value is present for this field, but you can customize it to a name that users in your organization recognize.

### 2. WordPress.com-built website URL
A WordPress.com-built website URL is the unique web address assigned to each WordPress.com-built website, allowing you to access your specific WordPress.com-built website.   

### 3. Graph Connector Agent
The graph connector agent acts as a bridge between your WordPress.com instance and the connector APIs, enabling secure and efficient data transfer. In this step, select the agent configuration you want to use for your connector.  

If you have not installed the [Microsoft Graph connector agent](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=104045) already, you can [download the agent installer](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=104045) and follow the installation instructions to set it up. Once installed, ensure that the agent is configured correctly to connect your on-premises WordPress.com instance with the Graph connector. 

### 4. Authentication Type
We support the basic authentication method. To enable and configure basic authentication in WordPress.com, find more details [here](https://make.WordPress.com/core/2020/11/05/application-passwords-integration-guide/).  

### 5. Staged rollout to limited audience
Deploy this connection to a limited user base if you want to validate it in Copilot and other Search surfaces before expanding the rollout to a broader audience.

At this point, you are ready to create the connection for WordPress.com-built website. You can click on the ‘**Create**’ button to publish your connection and index published posts and pages from your WordPress.com-built website.  

For other settings, like Access Permissions, Data inclusion rules, Schema, Crawl frequency etc., we set defaults based on what works best with WordPress.com-built website data. The default values settings are as follows.

**Page** | **Settings** | **Default Values**
--- | ---- | ---
Users | Access Permissions | All published pages or posts indexed using the WordPress.com connector are visible to all Microsoft 365 users in your tenant, from Microsoft Search or Copilot.
Content | Index Content | All published posts and pages are selected by default.
Content | Manage Properties | To check default properties and their schema, [click here](#content).
Sync | Incremental Crawl | Frequency: Every 15 mins
Sync | Full crawl | Frequency: Every day

If you want to edit any of these values, you need to choose the ‘**Custom Setup**’ option. 

## Custom Setup 

Custom setup is for those admins who want to edit the default values for settings. Once you click on the ‘Custom Setup’ option, you should see three other tabs – Users, Content, and Sync. 

### Users 

**Access permissions**

Currently only published pages and posts from your WordPress.com-built websites are indexed. All data indexed using the WordPress.com connector is visible to all Microsoft 365 users in your tenant, from Microsoft Search or Copilot.

### Content 

**Filter the Indexed Content**   

You can specify conditions for indexed content. For example, you can choose to index posts or pages and choose to index posts associated to specific categories.  

Use the preview results button to verify the sample values of the selected properties and filters. 

**Manage Properties**

Here, you can add or remove available properties from your WordPress.com data source, assign a schema to the property (define whether a property is **searchable, queryable, retrievable or refinable**), change the semantic label and add an alias to the property. Properties that are selected by default are listed below. 

**Source Property** | **Label** |**Description**| **Schema**
--- | ---- | --- | ---
Author | Authors | Name of all the people who participated/collaborated on the item in the data source.  | Search, Query, Retrieve
Categories  |  |  | Query, Retrieve, Refine

### Sync 

You can configure full and incremental crawls based on the scheduling options present here. By default, incremental crawl is set for every 15 minutes, and full crawl is set for every day. If needed, you can adjust these schedules to fit your data refresh needs.

## Troubleshooting
After publishing your connection, you can review the status under the **Data Sources** tab in the [admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com). To learn how to make updates and deletions, see [Manage your connector](manage-connector.md).
